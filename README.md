# kanji-stroke-order

display stroke order for every kanji in a sentence, helpful for Japanese
learners handwriting sentences

the stroke order SVGs are taken from [KanjiVG](https://kanjivg.tagaini.net/)

## to do
- don't refresh on literally every input change
- put non svg'd text into spans? maybe group it together first for block
  styling. style non-kanji to the center
- consider adding options for colors or animations, etc.
- performance improvements?
